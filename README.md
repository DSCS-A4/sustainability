# This one includes "financial data" tab on the app, 

# The user is supposed to enter the ticker of the desired company and get some financtial data.

# So far the calls are from the Finnhub API for company profile2, news sentiment and basic financials

# the tables might seem a little messy, i will work on makin them look better

# one issue i ran into was that before the initial entry, there is an error message, I want to stop the script before the ticker is entered and for it to continue after but im not sure how to do that :P
